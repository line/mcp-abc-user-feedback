# How to contribute to ABC User Feedback MCP Server

First of all, thank you so much for taking your time to contribute! ABC User Feedback MCP Server is not very different from any other open source projects. It will
be fantastic if you help us by doing any of the following:

- File an issue in [the issue tracker](https://github.com/line/mcp-abc-user-feedback/issues)
  to report bugs and propose new features and improvements.
- Ask a question using [the issue tracker](https://github.com/line/mcp-abc-user-feedback/issues).
- Contribute your work by sending [a pull request](https://github.com/line/mcp-abc-user-feedback/pulls).

## Development

You can freely fork the project, clone the forked repository, and start editing.

You may use the following npm scripts for development:

* `npm run format`: Format source code with [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
* `npm run format:check`: Silently run `format` and report formatting errors
* `npm run build`: Build TypeScript code into JavaScript. The built files will
  be placed in `dist/`.

We lint and build on CI, but it is always nice to check them before
uploading a pull request.

## Contributor license agreement

When you are sending a pull request and it's a non-trivial change beyond fixing typos, please make sure to sign
[the ICLA (individual contributor license agreement)](https://cla-assistant.io/line/mcp-abc-user-feedback). Please
